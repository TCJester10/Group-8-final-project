## Database
- Please see the ERD documentation which outlines our provisional database. Currently, the database is made up of 4 tables, county information, soil information, timeseries data, and weather data. This data was pulled from Kaggle and will be used to create a machine learning model to try to predict droughts. The .csv files in the Resources folder were imported into the Postgres DB as provisional data. 
- The Machine Learning Model will be connected to the Postgres DB via Amazon Web Services. Once we have the complete data set in Postgres we will utilize AWS relational database service (RDS) to host the database on the cloud so it can be accessed by the entire team. This will allow us to easily connect the our machine learning model to the database.
