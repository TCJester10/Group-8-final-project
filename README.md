![Drought Score](https://github.com/TCJester10/Group-8-final-project/blob/Tessa/Images/Screenshot%20(118).png)

This is the main image to focus on. What this shows is that most every county shown is not in a drought. This data will be useful in showing how many counties are 
in drought and how scores have changed over time. 

![Avg Precip](https://github.com/TCJester10/Group-8-final-project/blob/Tessa/Images/Screenshot%20(119).png)

What this is is just a simple value statement of the avg. precip across all counties in mm per day. 

![Avg. Precip over time](https://github.com/TCJester10/Group-8-final-project/blob/Tessa/Images/Screenshot%20(120).png)

What this shows is the change over the years in avg. precip over time. As can be seen there isn't one trend to really focus on. It will be interesting to look at the 
geographic trends as the project advances. 

## Future considerations
What I want to look into is specifics. What I have currently is just info for everywhere. I want to focus on Texas. I also was only able to get the data up to 2016 only
running. I hope to have all the data ready by next week. All in all I am excited to see what next week will bring.
