# Machine Learning

## Which model did you choose and why?
- We chose a Random Forest because we are using tabular data with thousands of data points. A Random Forest model will be quicker than a Neural Network while achieving roughly the same accuracy. It will also have the added benefit of being far more interpretable than a Neural Network.
- We chose a Random Forest model over Logistic Regression because we have thousands of data points and this may overwhelm a Logistic Regression model.
- We chose a Random Forest model over a Support Vector Machine because SVMs are great for binary classification, but we want to predict drought on five levels.
